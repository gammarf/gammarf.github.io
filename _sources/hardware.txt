Various RTL-SDR products exist, and the accessories (antennas, amplifiers, filters) are even more plentiful.  Here are some tips for picking the right stuff.

  1. The metal-cased RTL-USB sticks on Amazon work pretty well.  Look for something with a low PPM.

  2. It's critical to have the right antenna for the job.  If you are scanning different frequency bands, have antennas that suit each one.

  3. Sharing an antenna (through a splitter) results in less power being fed to each stick.  One antenna to two sticks, half the power.  And so on.

  4. If you keep your antenna next to a window, you'll see a big increase in power over keeping it far from a window.  If you keep it outside the window, even on the outside ledge, you may see a much larger increase.

  5. For ADS-B, get one of the RTL-SDR dongles specifically made for this (you can find them on Amazon); they include an amplifier and filter.  You also definitely need an antenna that covers the ADS-B frequency band.

  6. Keep your sticks far from generators of EM noise, like your PC and monitor.  Use long USB cables if necessary.  Clamp on ferrite beads to each end of the USB cables.

  7. You can fit about 4 sticks on a USB 2 port before performance issues occur.  You might get away with 5.

  8. If you use your sticks with a USB hub, make sure the hub is externally powered.
