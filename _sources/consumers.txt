KCΓRF Dashboards
================
Data from nodes can be visualized in different ways, aside from the webtools.
For an example, see the `KCGRF Grafana dashboards <http://gammarf.io:3000/dashboard/db/autizmo>`_.

    After running freqwatch on the client...

    ... one can monitor the power on Kibana.

Web Tools
=========

To access the web tools, navigate to ``http://[server]:8080``.  For a
demo, see the `Kansas City cluster tools <http://gammarf.io:8080>`_.

**The times shown in the web tools are in UTC**

Snapshots
---------
Snapshots sent to the server by the ΓRF client can be viewed on this page.

Smaller snapshots yield better performing graphs.  Plotly documentation and
personal experience indicate that the browser used to view the graphs has
a significant impact on responsiveness.  Chrome seems to perform much better
with dense Plotly graphs than Firefox.

Channels
--------
There are two channels tools: Channel List, and Channel Maps.  Periodically
(by default, 0000 UTC daily) the time series' for frequencies are analyzed
to find *channels*.  Frequencies that are adjacent and that share a certain
amount of activity (hit) similarity are considered part of the same channel.

The Channel Map is a graphic representation of discovered channels.  Its
purpose is to give the user some high-level idea of where activity is occuring
in the RF spectrum.  Zoom in to the graphic to view channels more closely.
Dots on the graph that are adjacent and the same color are part of the same
channel.

The Channel List is simply a list of channels identified, with some
information about each channel.  This information includes average power
at the center frequency, the estimated width of the channel, and an
*activity signature* for the channel.  The acitivity signature consists
of four numbers: three coefficients to a quadratic equation that matches
the channel's traffic density plot, and a density number.  The channel
signature is derived from the activity of the channel over the previous
24 hours.  Future releases will use this signature information to help
identify potentially related channels.

By clicking a channel frequency in the Channel List, one can view a hit
history of the channel, and channel information.  The channel's traffic
density plot is shown below these.

Since the task to identify channels runs daily, the number of entries in
the *channels* PostgreSQL table can increase quickly.  For this reason
another periodic task is run that delete channels of a certain age from
this table.  By default, channels are held for three days.
