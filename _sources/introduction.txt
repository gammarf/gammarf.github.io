Elevator Pitch
==============
ΓRF allows you to build a cluster of distributed nodes for radio signal
collection and analysis.  These nodes run a set of modules which provide
various types of functionality (e.g. collection of a particular type of
signal).  The data nodes collect is sent to a server for processing and
presentation, hence the data collected by nodes can synthesized into coherent
products.  Nodes use cheap (~$20) software defined radios, so the system
is perfect for both professional and hobby use.

Status
======
The client is changing rapidly.  Download it `here <https://github.com/covertcodes/gammarf>`_.
The server is under continuous development and is not yet released.  However,
we will set up a server instance for whomever would like to experiment with
ΓRF.  See the KCΓRF web interface `here <http://gammarf.io:8080>`_ for some
idea of where we're at on the server side.

Organization
============
Computers with RTL-SDR / HackRF USB software-defined radios (SDRs) running
the ΓRF client software are called *nodes*.  Nodes can run a variety of
*modules* that utilize the SDRs in module-specific ways.  The information
gleaned by the modules can be used locally, or sent to a server to be used
in conjunction with data from other nodes.

**Example**: Let's say a geographically diverse group of ΓRF users are
interested in tracking a particular set of aircraft.  They can run ΓRF
clients with the ADS-B (aircraft telemetry) module, and send *hit* data to
their server when an aircraft in the set is seen by their node.  The
server can combine the data from the various nodes and create maps and
timelines relating to the aircraft in the set.

**Example**: A group of ham radio operators program their geographically
diverse ΓRF nodes with the frequencies of repeaters in their area.
Repeater activity from each node is aggregated on their server, and the
activity of each repeater is visualized in a graph.  The most active times
on each are identified, and users hundreds of miles away from a given repeater
can see its traffic patterns.

Some other things that can be done, either individually or cooperatively with
other clients, include:
    * tracking satellites and other space objects
    * estimating the location of transmitters using TDOA
    * building direction finding networks (e.g. for fox hunts)
